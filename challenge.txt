Frontend Challenge — Pickup & Delivery
Flow (React or React Native)
Timebox
90–120 minutes (document any trade-offs or unfinished stretch goals).
Platform
You may implement this challenge in React (web) or React Native (mobile).
● If React (web): Use any build tool (Vite/CRA/Next in SPA mode).
● If React Native: Use Expo (recommended) or vanilla RN.
Tech Constraints
● No backend calls; everything runs locally.
● State may be React state, Context, Redux, Zustand, or URL/route params.
● Any styling approach is fine.
● Navigation:
○ React (web): use React Router (or equivalent).
○ React Native: use React Navigation (stack recommended).
User Stories
1) Login (/login or LoginScreen)
● Email + Password fields, “Sign in” button.
● Validation: email format; password ≥ 6 chars.
● On success, redirect/navigate to Delivery Preference.
2) Delivery Preference (/preference or PreferenceScreen)
● Choose one: In-store pickup, Delivery, Curbside pickup.
● Show fields based on selection:
○ In-store: date & time you’ll arrive.
○ Delivery: address (single line), date & time for delivery.
○ Curbside: car description (free text), date & time for arrival.
● Submit navigates to Summary.
3) Summary (/summary or SummaryScreen)
● Display: user email, selected preference, and its fields.
● Provide Edit to return and adjust choices.
● Provide Sign out / Reset to clear state and go back to login.
Acceptance Criteria
Auth & Guards
● Unauthenticated users hitting Preference/Summary are redirected to Login.
● Authenticated users hitting Login are redirected to Preference.
Validation & UX
● Inline, helpful errors; disable submit until valid.
● Date/time must be in the future (relative to now).
● Focus management (web) or sensible keyboard behavior (mobile).
State
● Choices persist when navigating between steps.
● Clearing state on Sign out.
● Nice-to-have: persistence across app reload (localStorage/AsyncStorage).
Accessibility / Mobile ergonomics
● Web: semantic labels, keyboard nav, ARIA where needed.
● Mobile: accessible labels, proper touch targets, safe-area padding, avoiding keyboard
overlap.
Testing
● Include basic tests for critical paths:
○ Successful login → navigation/redirect.
○ Guarded navigation when unauthenticated.
○ Conditional fields render per selection.
○ Past time validation blocks submit.
○ Summary reflects entered data.
Testing libraries:
● Web: React Testing Library + Vitest/Jest.
● RN: @testing-library/react-native + Jest.
Mock Rules (No Backend)
● Any valid email + password length ≥ 6 “logs in”.
● Address required for Delivery (8–120 chars).
● Car description required for Curbside (5–120 chars).
● Date+time must be strictly in the future.
Deliverables
● A runnable project:
○ Web: npm i && npm run dev (or Next npm run dev).
○ RN (Expo): npm i && npx expo start.
● README covering:
○ Platform chosen and why
○ Setup & run instructions
○ Design decisions (state, navigation, validation)
○ What you’d improve with more time
○ How to run tests (npm test)
● 3–5 meaningful tests as described above.
Stretch Goals (Optional)
● Store hours validation (e.g., 09:00–21:00).
● Reusable form primitives or schema validation (Zod/Yup).
● URL/query-param state (web) or deep link params (mobile).
● Offline-friendly UX (no assumptions of connectivity).
● Mobile: date/time pickers native to platform; address field with basic local suggestions
(no network).
● Polished mobile layout (keyboard-aware views), or web responsive layout.
